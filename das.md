# DAS

We intend to create and develop a decentralized community in order to have a decentralized management and decision-making structure, united by common interests in the field of creative development. In the decentralized community, there is no single central body or leader to control and manage the community. Instead, decisions are made by consensus among community members.

Ownership and further development of the platform will be distributed among the members.&#x20;

Owners making any changes will be community management token $KDS (Tokenomics).

For example, proposals could be:

* Development of new functions of the platform
* Changing of charities participating in contributions
* Any changes in the management of the organization, etc.

Part of the management functions we will try to automate by using smart contracts to form a full-fledged DAO community. Interchain minting NFT collection
