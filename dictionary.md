**Web3 technology** is the third generation of the Internet, which provides a smarter, more personalized and decentralized approach to online communications. It includes technologies such as blockchain, digital law (NFT) and decentralized applications (DApps). One important aspect of Web3 is its ability to provide a more honest and open platform for information exchange and interaction.

**NFT** (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is used to manage and account for unique digital items such as images, videos, music and other forms of media.

**Decentralized community** is a group of people with common goals and interests that has a decentralized management and decision-making structure. Decentralized communities can be organized in different forms, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), online communities, or collective projects. They can be related to different topics, such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, social networking, social responsibility, etc.

**DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), is a type of organization that is run through code rather than by a group of individuals. It is decentralized because it is not controlled by any single entity and is instead governed by its members through a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain network. The rules and decision-making processes of a DAO are transparent, and all members have an equal say in how the organization is run. This allows for a more democratic and decentralized form of organization compared to traditional centralized structures.
