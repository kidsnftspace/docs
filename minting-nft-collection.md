# Minting NFT collection

Interchain minting refers to the process of creating and issuing NFTs on multiple different blockchains, as opposed to just one. Such function (opportunity) allows for the same collection of NFTs to exist in multiple locations at once, increasing their accessibility and reach.

There are several benefits to interchain minting an NFT collection:

* Greater accessibility: By minting on multiple blockchains, the collection can be made available to a wider audience, and can be bought and sold on different marketplaces.
* Increased scarcity: Having the same collection on multiple blockchains can increase its scarcity, as the total supply of NFTs would be split among the different blockchains.
* Better resilience: By minting on multiple blockchains, it makes the collection less vulnerable to issues on any one specific blockchain, such as network congestion or smart contract bugs.

NFT holders will be granted the following privileges:

* Participation in the $KDS management token airdrop
* Receiving of profit share from Royalty of NFT sales on Marketplaces
* Receiving of a portion of the profit from commissions on the provision of platform services (Monetization)
* Gaining access to private community
* Distribution of $KDS token according to tokenomics
